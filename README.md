Speech Emotion Recognition
This project implements a speech emotion recognition system using the RAVDESS dataset. It employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify emotions based on audio features.

Overview
Dataset: RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
Technologies: Python, Google Colab, librosa, soundfile, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
Getting Started
Google Colab: Open a new notebook and mount Google Drive to access the RAVDESS dataset.
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the required libraries.
Feature Extraction: Extract audio features (MFCC, Chroma, Mel spectrogram).
Model Training: Train the MLP model on the extracted features.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy and F1 score.
Model Persistence: Save the trained model for future use.
